## Core Research Questions

1. At the province/state level, are mental health outcomes (e.g. prevalence of poor mental health, hospitalizations for mental illness) more strongly associated with demographic composition (e.g. % youth, % female, % older adults) or socioeconomic indicators (median income, % with college degree, unemployment rate)?

2. Do environmental factors (e.g. heat waves, cold spells) appear correlated with changes in population-level mental health outcomes?

3. How do these associations vary over time (e.g. pre/post pandemic or across several years)?

## Data source suggestion:

Mental Health & Socioeconomic Indicators

  - US: CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) summary tables, SAMHSA reports, or [CDC Data Explorer](https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/DataExplorer/)

  - Demographics US Census Bureau (via `tidycensus` [R package](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/)).

  - Weather/Environment: NOAA (for US), Environment Canada, or UK Met Office (for Tom’s idea). Daily/monthly average temp, extreme event counts.
  
  
## Workflow


1. Data Wrangling

  - Use tidyverse to import, clean, and merge aggregate datasets.

  - Create a panel dataset: rows = region × year (or month), columns = mental health outcomes, demographics, SES, weather indicators.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis

  - Descriptive stats: distributions of mental health outcomes across regions.

  - Geospatial plots: `choropleths` (via `sf` + `ggplot2`) to map prevalence across states/provinces.

  - Trend analysis: line plots of outcomes over time, highlighting key events (e.g. 2020 pandemic start).

  - Correlation heatmaps: demographic, SES, weather factors vs. mental health outcomes.

3. Comparative Modeling (Exploratory, not causal)

  - Simple linear models: regress aggregate mental health outcome on demographics vs. SES predictors. Compare R².

  - Regularized regression (`glmnet`): check which predictors are retained.

  - Event overlay: mark heat/cold waves on time series plots of outcomes, look for spikes.

4. Communication Outputs

  - Markdown report with visual summaries.

  - Interactive dashboard (optional) with shiny or flexdashboard to allow filtering by region/year.
