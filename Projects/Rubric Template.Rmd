## Additional Notes

- Each member must submit a **1-page reflection** describing their contributions (plots, analysis, writing, coordination).  
- Plots must be **original** (no copying from external sources) and reproducible.  
- Encourage rotation in leading the discussion of plots/questions within the group; teamwork is part of the grade.
